            A one-stop shop for all horror related content. Deployed the app
            resiliently through AWS by using ELB with auto scaling to maintain
            instances running at all times, Cloudfront to deliver the app to
            users quickly, and IGW with NACL and security groups to keep the app
            safe. Displayed haunted houses near the userâ€™s location using MapBox
            and allowed the user to transition from location to location.
            Designed the app with Bootstrap to align content when using the app
            on different size devices and keep the design pattern consistent
            throughout the app. Integrated TypeScript and Webpack, which
            compiled all the files into one and forced potential errors to be
            resolved early in the project.
